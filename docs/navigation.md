# Navigation

## New Navigation Tree

Creating a new navigation first requires giving it a title, which will sit, at
the root of the tree, and a type.

## Types

There are 3 types available when creating a new navigation tree although if it
is the first one the you will only have type of Root available.

### Root

The first branch of the tree will exist at the root of the site and further
nested branches will build nested routes from the root.

Only Pages that HAVE NOT already been selected under a Root or Page type will
be available to select.

### Link

Only Pages that HAVE already been selected under a Root or Page type will
be available to select.

### Page

The first branch of the tree will exist at the path of the selected page

Only Pages that HAVE already been selected under a Root or Page type will
be available to select.
